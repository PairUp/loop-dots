OVERVIEW
========

DotDotDot, also known as dotdotdot, aka '...' is a simple system for managing
and sharing your *nix dot (user configuration) files.

After installing this software, you should have access to a command line
program called '...'.

You can run `... --help` for further information on using DotDotDot.

INSTALLATION
============

To install ..., run:

    sudo make install

This will install ... in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.

To install it somewhere else you can use the DOTDOTDOTBIN environment
variable. For example:

    DOTDOTDOTBIN=$HOME/bin make install

Installing ... creates a symlink from your bin directory to this directory,
so don't remove this directory after installation.

The usual way to obtain this software is through github.com.

    cd ~/src
    git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot.git
    cd dotdotdot
    sudo make install
    ... --install

UPGRADING
=========

Since the installed program is a symlink, upgrading ... is as simple as:

    cd ~/src/dotdotdot
    git pull
